Linking multiple structs together is how you make large complex data
structures. You link them with struct pointers typically.

Will also be learning about linked lists.

To store a flexible amount of data you need something more extensible
than an array. You need a linked list.

Linked list is an abstract data structure. It can be used to store a
lot of different kinds of data.

A linked list stores a piece of data and a "link" to another piece of
data. As long as you know where the list starts you can travel along
the list of links.

Linked lists allows very quick inserting of data. You need to create
a recursive structure.

In C a recursive struct is a struct that contains a link to another
struct of the same type. Recursive structs contain pointers to the
other structures of the same type.

See linked_list_example.c

in C99/C11 you can declare local function variables in the middle of
code. In other versions though all must be declared at the top of the
function
